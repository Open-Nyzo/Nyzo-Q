## Private IPv4 Addresses

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255  
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255  
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 

In April 2012, IANA allocated the block 100.64.0.0/10 (100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255, netmask 255.192.0.0) for use in carrier-grade NAT scenarios  
This address block should not be used on private networks or on the public Internet. 

In IPv4, link-local addresses are codified in RFC 6890 and RFC 3927.    
The block 169.254.0.0/16 was allocated for this purpose
